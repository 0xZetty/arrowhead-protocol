# ArrowHead Protocol 🏹

> **Verifiable Sequencer Latency Profiling for High-Frequency DeFi & RWA on Robinhood Chain.**

ArrowHead is a specialized diagnostic utility and stress-testing protocol designed exclusively for **Robinhood Chain (RHC)**. It acts as an on-chain probe, executing atomic "Arrow Shots" to benchmark the network's true performance (sequencer latency, gas volatility) from a developer's perspective.

## ⚡ Key Features

- **Sequencer Stress Test:** Generates controlled transaction bursts to measure sequencer responsiveness under load.
- **HFT-Grade Metrics:** Calculates precise block production intervals and transaction finality times for algorithmic traders.
- **RWA Synchronization:** Verifies timestamp integrity for bridging off-chain assets.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Core:** Solidity (Hardhat/Foundry)
- **Analytics:** Python (Web3.py), Pandas
- **Network:** Robinhood Chain Testnet / Arbitrum Orbit
- **Explorer:** Blockscout API

## 🚀 Usage (Alpha)

This project is currently under active development for the **Arbitrum Open House 2026**.
